# Choice Assist
Hia! This little app allows you to easily make your own interactive deck-builder style Choose Your Own Adventures. As you make your choices it will keep track of how much points/money/etc you have remaining and let you know when you're over budget. Once you're done it'll give you a shareable link to a page showing which choices you made.

I built choice-assist because normally these type of CYOAs are [distributed as static images](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/) and I got sick of manually recording what I've chosen.

## Demo
["Get A Life" running on glitch.com](https://choice-assist.glitch.me/)

## Getting Started
I recommend using a nifty service called glitch.com. Glitch does all the dirty work of getting your web app up and running. Plus it's got a lovely community :)

[To get started go to the choice-assist glitch project.](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/choice-assist)

## Using Glitch
If you're reading this on glitch.com you should hopefully see a button called `ðŸ•¶ Show` in the top left corner â†–. Hitting it will take you to the site you've made. Before you get started making your own adventure first create a glitch account (or sign in). This is important because if you're not logged in then any new glitches you create will be considered anonymous and [will be **deleted after 5 days**](https://glitch.com/faq#restrictions). If you don't own the current glitch you're viewing then you should see a button labelled `Remix This ðŸŽ¤` in the top right corner â†—. When you remix an glitch you take a copy of a glitch project. Since you own that copy so you can modify it to your hearts content.

## Editing
All the content of an adventure is stored in a file called _deckData.json_ in the _src/_ folder. However to make things easier choice-assist has a visual editor which you can access at //\<domain\>/editor. For example if you've remixed choice-assist on glitch.com and your glitch project name is "pirate-cyoa" the address you would go to edit your adventure would be https://pirate-cyoa.glitch.me/editor. Any images you want to use should be uploaded to the _assets/_ folder.

## Customising The Look
If you know a bit of CSS you can easily customise your adventure to look however you like. choice-assist uses the Vue.js framework which splits different parts of the page up into "components". Components are stored as _.vue_ files in _src/components/_ and _src/pages/_. The CSS behind each component can be found be at the bottom of each component file in the `<style>` section.

## Publishing
Choice Assist can either be set in development mode or production mode. Development makes creating your CYOA in the first place easier and is the default mode. Changes you make in glitch will appear live almost instantly. However development mode is also slower. This is particularly noticeable if no one has visited your CYOA in a little while. The next time someone does it can take quite a bit of time to load. Production mode avoids this by skipping the costly process of "re-building" your CYOA every time your CYOA is accessed after being idle for a while. So use development mode when you're first making your CYOA and production mode when you're finished.

To change between modes open _.env_ and change "NODE_ENV=" to "NODE_ENV=production" (for production mode) or "NODE_ENV=development" (for development mode).

When in production mode your CYOA won't update at all when you make a change unless you force it to do so. You can do that by going to _.env_ and changing "REBUILD=" to "REBUILD=true". Once its finished rebuilding and your CYOA had been updated it is recommended you change "REBUILD=true" back to "REBUILD=" otherwise it will rebuild your site every so often and cause it to run slow.

## Advanced Guide (ie Using Without glitch.com)
Although glitch.com makes it easy to quickly make your own CYOA with Choice Assist there's absolutely no need to use glitch if you feel confident hosting it yourself. You'll need Node.js installed but that's about it. 

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests (lol, what tests?)
npm run unit

# run e2e tests (yep, sometime I'll get round to adding some tests)
npm run e2e

# run all tests (one day)
npm test
```
