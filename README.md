# Choice Assist

Hia! This little app allows you to easily make your own choose your own adventure in the form of a deck builder which other people can fill out and share their results. It will keep track of how much points/money/etc that you have remaining or how much you're over budget.

I built this because I got sick of doing this all in my head or writing it down on paper.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
